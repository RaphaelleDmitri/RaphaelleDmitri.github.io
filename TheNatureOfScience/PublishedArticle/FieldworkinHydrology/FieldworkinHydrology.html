        This article advocates for a return to discovery-based fieldwork in the
        field of hydrology. While modern science often relies heavily on
        computer models to predict water system behaviors, this study emphasizes
        the value of direct observation and on-site exploration.

      <h2>Key Ideas:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>System Behavior First:</strong> Understanding how water
          systems behave in real-world environments provides context that models
          alone can't capture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Educational Value:</strong> Fieldwork develops essential
          observational and analytical skills among students and researchers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Balanced Approach:</strong> The integration of fieldwork with
          modeling can lead to more accurate, nuanced understanding of
          hydrological processes.
        </li>
