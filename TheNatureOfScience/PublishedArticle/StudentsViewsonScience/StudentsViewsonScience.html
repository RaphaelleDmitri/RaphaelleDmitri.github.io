        <strong>Study Title:</strong> Junior High School Students’ Views of
        Nature of Science: Evidence from a Private School in Davao Region,
        Philippines
      </p>
      <p>
        This study explored how junior high school students in the Philippines
        perceive the Nature of Science (NOS)—a concept that includes how
        scientific knowledge is developed, validated, and understood. The
        findings revealed that students generally hold transitional views,
        meaning they are in-between naive and informed understandings of NOS
        concepts.

      <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Imagination and Creativity:</strong> Gender differences were
          observed—suggesting that male and female students may perceive or
          engage with creative aspects of science differently.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tentativeness and Observation-Inference:</strong>
          Understanding of these aspects varied across grade levels, indicating
          that exposure and maturity influence comprehension.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Educational Implication:</strong> There is a clear need for
          targeted interventions to help students develop a deeper, more
          accurate view of scientific processes—crucial for nurturing scientific
          literacy in future generations.
