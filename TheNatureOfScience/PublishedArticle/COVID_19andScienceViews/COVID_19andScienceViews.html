        <strong>Study Title:</strong> Views on the Nature of Science, Beliefs,
        Trust in the Government, and COVID-19 Pandemic Preventive Behavior Among
        Undergraduate Students
      </p>
      <p>
        This research examined how Filipino undergraduate students'
        understanding of NOS, their beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic, and
        their trust in government impacted their preventive health behaviors
        during the pandemic.

      <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Understanding NOS Matters:</strong> Students with a stronger
          grasp of scientific concepts and the nature of science were more
          likely to follow recommended health practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Beliefs Influence Behavior:</strong> Perceptions about the
          seriousness and legitimacy of the pandemic shaped personal actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Government Trust Is Not Enough:</strong> Surprisingly, trust
          in the government alone did not predict behavior, highlighting the
          importance of independent scientific understanding.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Educational Impact:</h2>
      <p>
        The study suggests that enhancing NOS education can empower individuals
        to make informed decisions during public health crises.
