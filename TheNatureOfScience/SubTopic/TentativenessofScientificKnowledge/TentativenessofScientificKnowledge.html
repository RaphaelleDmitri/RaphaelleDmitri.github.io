              Scientific knowledge is tentative and subject to change as new
              evidence emerges. This characteristic ensures that science remains
              dynamic and self-correcting.

              <p>
                One of the most important—and often misunderstood—features of
                science is that scientific knowledge is tentative. This means it
                is always open to revision as new evidence becomes available.

              <h3>Why Science Changes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>New Discoveries:</strong> Advancements in technology
                  can reveal information that wasn't previously observable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reevaluation of Evidence:</strong> Existing data may
                  be reinterpreted in light of new theories or perspectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Peer Review and Replication:</strong> Continuous
                  scrutiny by the scientific community helps refine and improve
                  understanding.
                </li>

              <h3>Not a Weakness, But a Strength</h3>
              <p>
                The ability to adapt and improve makes science a powerful and
                self-correcting process. Changing our understanding of the world
                in response to new information is what drives scientific
                progress.
