              Scientific inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists
              study the natural world and propose explanations based on the
              evidence derived from their work. It is the foundation of
              scientific progress and discovery.

              <p>
                Scientific inquiry refers to the various approaches scientists
                use to investigate questions and uncover truths about the
                natural world. It’s not a single method, but rather a set of
                tools and strategies that work together to generate knowledge.

              <h3>Key Methods of Scientific Inquiry</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Observation:</strong> Scientists begin by observing
                  the world using their senses or tools (like telescopes or
                  microscopes) to gather information. Careful observation helps
                  identify patterns and raise questions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Experimentation:</strong> Controlled experiments allow
                  scientists to test hypotheses. By changing one variable at a
                  time and observing the results, they can draw conclusions
                  about cause-and-effect relationships.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Modeling:</strong> Models—whether physical,
                  mathematical, or computer-based—help scientists simulate
                  complex systems like climate patterns, ecosystems, or atomic
                  structures. Models are valuable for making predictions and
                  visualizing ideas.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Inquiry Process</h3>
              <p>Scientific inquiry is often iterative, involving cycles of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Asking questions</li>
                <li>Forming hypotheses</li>
                <li>Conducting investigations</li>
                <li>Analyzing data</li>
                <li>Drawing conclusions</li>
                <li>Revising ideas based on new evidence</li>
              </ul>
