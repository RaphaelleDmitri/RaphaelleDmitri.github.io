              Scientific theories and laws are fundamental components of the
              scientific method. Theories explain why phenomena occur, while
              laws describe how they occur under specific conditions.

              <h2>Scientific Theories and Laws: What’s the Difference?</h2>
              <p>
                A common misconception is that scientific theories become laws
                with enough evidence. In reality, theories and laws serve
                different purposes in science, and both are equally important.

                <h3>Scientific Theories</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of
                  some aspect of the natural world.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is based on a body of evidence and has withstood repeated
                  testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Examples: Theory of Evolution, Germ Theory of Disease, Theory
                  of Plate Tectonics
                </li>
                <li>Theories explain how and why things happen.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Scientific Laws</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A scientific law is a description of an observed phenomenon,
                  often expressed mathematically.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It describes patterns in nature that consistently occur under
                  certain conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Examples: Newton’s Laws of Motion, Law of Conservation of
                  Mass, Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
                </li>
                <li>
                  Laws describe what happens, but do not necessarily explain
                  why.
                </li>
              </ul>
